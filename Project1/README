About: 
    This program takes a netlist and produces a netlist annotated with logically
    placed gates. Because optimal placement is a n! problem, this approximates 
    placement using annealing. Soon it will also use numerical methods to aid the
    stochastic ones. 

Install: 
    - copy a netlist into ./ and call it netlist.txt
    - make 

Run:
    ./placer 

View results:
    ./display/draw_layout.py 
    Note: the GUI really only works for small
    netlists currently. As it does not support zoom or pan. 

Create your own input file:
    in the /verilog/ folder, run parser.pl 
    and give it two arguments, the filename of a 
    structural verilog file and the top verilog 
    module in the structural verilog file.
