This program does a vector add in three different kernels: 

Compile: 
    Type make 
Run: 
    Sequential kernel:
        Uses one thread to do a vector add
        Example: 
            ./HW2 1000 s
    Parallel kernel:
        Uses nthreads to do a vector add. Uses OpenMP; 
        Example:
            ./HW2 1000 p 
    Reduce kernel: 
        Uses nthreads to do a vector add. Uses OpenMP. 
        Example:
            ./HW2 1000 r
Test:
    make bench:
        Tests all configurations outlines above. Produces a CSV. 
        Does this by running bench.pl
    make test:
        tests parellel, modify submit-HW2 to test others. 
   
Requires: 
g++ -fopenmp
